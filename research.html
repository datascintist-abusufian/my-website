            direct factorization of the Helmoltz equation is a viable approach towards making this technique
            computationally efficient. This method does not work in 3D, and so what to do in this setting is the current

            have constructed a new class of quantum stabilizer codes based on rotation systems that generalize many
            existing code families, such as stellated codes, Kitaev's toric code etc. Since rotation systems fully
            encode how an undirected graph is 2-cell embedded on a closed 2-dimensional manifold, our codes can be
            viewed as a class of topological quantum codes. Extremal cyclically anticommuting lists of Paulis play a key
            role in this construction. Notions such as graph "checkerboardability" turn out to be important for deriving
            relationships between the number of encoded qubits, and the number of qubits used in the code, along with
            the genus of the manifold. Checkerboardability also influences the logical operators that one obtains from
            our constructions.

            group is important in the theory of quantum computing. For example, commuting sets of Paulis are central in
            the theory of quantum stabilizer codes, while anticommuting sets of Paulis are used to map Fermionic systems
            to qubit algebra, such as using the Jordan-Wigner transform, which allows Fermionic systems to be simulated
            using quantum computers. Anticommuting Paulis are also used in wireless communication, such as in the design
            of space-time codes. In this work, we study structure and cardinality of maximal sets of commuting and
            anticommuting Paulis in the setting of the abelian Pauli group. We provide necessary and sufficient
            conditions for anticommuting sets to be maximal, and present an efficient algorithm for generating
            anticommuting sets of maximum size. These results appear to be new, even though the Pauli group has been
            extremely well-studied before. The current version of our paper is available on arXiv. <span class="single__line subtitle__text m-top">Updates:</span> <span class="update-text">Nov 2019</span>:

            </span>.We start with an optimization problem with a polynomial objective function, and polynomial equality
            and inequality constraints, where the variables are integer-valued. We tackle the problem of how to
            efficiently map it to a quantum computer, specifically focusing on decreasing the qubit count needed to
            represent the problem. This is important for near-term applications in the NISQ era of quantum computing.
            The problem is first transformed into an unconstrained higher order binary optimization problem, and then
            quadratization techniques are employed to reduce it to an equivalent quadratic pseudo-boolean function
            (PBF). Finally roof duality and extended roof duality techniques are employed to automatically fix some of
            the binary variables in the PBF, to obtain a new PBF with less number of binary variables. This technique
            leads to a reduction in the number of required qubits in a problem-dependent fashion. <span class="single__line subtitle__text m-top">Updates:</span> <span class="update-text">Nov 2019:</span> A

            <p class="text__color--blue">[<a href="" class="text__link">More info</a>]</p> <span class="single__link subtitle__text">Joint work with Gabriel Fabien-Ouellet.</span>We design a recurrent neural-network for the task of
            estimating the interval velocity and the root-mean-square velocity in time, starting from CMP gathers. An
            important question that this work addresses is whether semblance calculation is strictly necessary or not
            for seismic velocity analysis, as is done in any conventional processing workflow. Our work shows that it is
            not, and in fact our opinion is that starting from the data itself as inputs for a ML based velocity
            estimation workflow, is much better than starting with semblance panels because semblance panels have
            strictly less information content than the gathers themselves. Our work assumes a horizontally layered
            medium, which is a standard assumption for seismic velocity analysis in time. <span class="single__line subtitle__text m-top">Updates:</span> <span class="update-text">Nov 2019:</span> This work

            We propose a supervised classification scheme for automatic segmentation of a seismic image. The image is
            broken up into tiles, and then persistent barcodes are derived from a sub- or super-level set filtration of
            the image tile. Polynomial features are then derived from this barcode representation. These barcodes track
            how homology changes as a function of the filtration. We show that these polynomial features can be used to
            classify the seismic images. The classification accuracy is comparable in performance to state-of-the-art
            CNNs for the same task. The TDA based method has the advantage that there is no need to augment the training
            data set based on rotations, as the topological features are rotation invariant. We test our method on the
            LANDMASS datasets. We are currently working on a draft of the full paper, to be put on arXiv soon. <span class="single__line subtitle__text m-top">Updates:</span>

  A. Levin.</span> In this work, we explore how to exploit the potential power of quantum annealers in an unusual
            tomographic challenge of estimating material percentages such as net-to-gross ratios using sparse
            offset-traveltime information. By restricting the constituent materials in an isotropic
            horizontally-stratified medium to a specific set with well-known acoustic properties, transmission
            tomography can provide the relative fraction of each material within the set of layers over which the ray
            traverses. In this paper, this problem is formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
            problem suitable for solving using a quantum annealer.
